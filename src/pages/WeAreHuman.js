      <h1>We are human</h1>
      <h4>We act like humans, we talk like humans, and we think like humans. And we call out anyone who does the opposite.</h4>
    </header>

    <h2 id="you-are-not-here-by-accident">You are not here by accident</h2>
    <p>We hired you for a reason. There’s no need to prove yourself or worry about “fitting in.” You’re here. You made it. You get it. Let your work do the convincing.</p>
    <h2 id="we-hire-differently">We hire differently</h2>
    <p>Most companies operate under the premise that employees should be replaceable like parts of an assembly line. We choose our people more carefully. We bring them in if we think they’re a good fit, regardless of whether we have work for them right away. What that means: You are more than your title. Bring yourself (rough edges and all) to work each day, not your “developer” or “designer” costume.</p>
    <h2 id="get-autonomous">Get autonomous</h2>
    <p>You’re given an incredible amount of freedom and autonomy at Mindera. That goes for everyone. It’s up to you to figure out how to approach a problem. No one is going to make you do it their way. We know that sounds awesome, but here’s the rub: With freedom comes a ton of ownership and responsibility. Life is easy when someone is telling you what to do. It’s also boring, and it prevents you from being invested in what you’re doing. Since you control your own destiny here, you’ll likely be more emotional about your work. We believe that’s better than the alternative. Can you imagine coming to work each day and not caring? We can’t.</p>
    <h2 id="work-together">Work together</h2>
    <p>Our flat structure calls for it by necessity. Being a leader may feel unnatural at first, but we expect everyone to step up and own part of the project. It’s kind of like playing basketball: When someone passes you the ball, you’re in charge of what to do with it next.</p>
    <h2 id="talk-like-a-human">Talk like a human</h2>
    <p>There’s a lot of bad work out there. One of the culprits is the way we talk to each other. In an industry that requires a ton of communication between clients, agencies and suppliers, it’s important not to let acronyms, “proprietary processes,” and buzzwords lead to confusion and time lost. Here’s what we mean:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Instead of saying “leverage,” say “use.”</li>
      <li>Instead of saying “action item,” say “to do.”</li>
      <li>Instead of saying “empowering consumers,” just go home and try again in the morning.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="to-avoid-robot-speak-follow-these-three-simple-rules-">To avoid robot speak, follow these three simple rules:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>pretend you’re talking to your mom. Your mom doesn’t know what “CPG” or “propagation planning” mean. And it’s not because she’s not a smart lady. She’s just not entrenched in industry jargon.</li>
      <li>don’t be afraid to ask. Sometimes you need to stop and ask the room to define what exactly “responsive design” or “social business” means to them. It’s OK.</li>
      <li>get on the same page. Sometimes the words don’t matter as long as everyone’s speaking the same language. Try to acknowledge when words are getting in the way and do something about it.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="things-you-should-say">Things you should say</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>“Why are we doing it this way?”</li>
      <li>“Is there a better alternative?”</li>
      <li>“<strong>__</strong> worked really well last time. Can we do it even better on this project?”</li>
      <li>“Let’s get a drink and discuss it.”</li>
      <li>“Foos?”</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="things-you-shouldn-t-say">Things you shouldn’t say</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>“It is what it is.” No, it’s not. It is what you make it.</li>
      <li>“That’s not my job.” If you ever hear someone say this, start flipping desks. It’s all your job.</li>
      <li>“Who cares?” Well, we do.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="you-re-more-than-your-title">You’re more than your title</h2>
    <p>Humans are unpredictable. You can’t replace one person with another the same way you swap tires on a car. Workplaces that try to control human nature might become miserable fast. People who talk about themselves in terms of their title freak us out: “I’m a developer, so I do things like this.” No. You’re a person first and a developer second. Show your true colors.</p>
    <h2 id="everyone-is-creative">Everyone is creative</h2>
    <p>But nobody is a creative. Creativity is a skill, not a title. So don’t ever say, “I’m not creative.” We will find the creativity inside you and drag it out, kicking and screaming :). We don’t put our energy into questions like, “Whose name goes on the award entry?” Instead, we ask questions like, “Is this project right for us?” and “How can we do something unique and innovative that works for the business?”</p>
    <h2 id="nobody-s-gonna-hold-your-hand">Nobody’s gonna hold your hand</h2>
    <p>This is a busy place, and you’ll often be on your own to figure things out. Don’t be afraid to ask for help, but don’t rely on others to hold your hand. You might be tempted to say something such as, “It would be nice if someone would organize the [server, kitchen, furniture].” At Mindera, you are that someone. If you want to update, change, or fix something, go for it. Seriously. Every awesome thing you see is like that because someone like you decided to do it.</p>
    <h2 id="human-truths">Human truths</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>truth #1</strong>: Humans are not perfect. Don’t be afraid to fail. And when you do, you might as well fail spectacularly. This is how we grow and learn.</li>
      <li><strong>truth #2</strong>: Humans have voices. Yours is as valuable as anyone else’s. Use it. Singing out loud is encouraged.</li>
      <li><strong>truth #3</strong>: Humans are unique. Do you love Portuguese Pop Music (Pimba)? Do you prefer your desk covered with sunflowers? There’s no need to hide it. Be yourself. That’s how you’ll fit in here.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="humans-are-not-resources-">Humans are not “resources”</h2>
    <p><em>Human resources</em>. What an awful phrase. We don’t have an HR department. New hires are interviewed by the people who will be working with them. So get ready to care a lot about the people you work with.</p>
