    <h2 id="we-work-together">We work together</h2>
    <p>We insist on working collaboratively. No rockstars. No departments. The whole team owns the whole project, together.</p>
    <h2 id="we-aren-t-big-on-hierarchy">We aren’t big on hierarchy</h2>
    <p>We don’t have an internal “org chart.” The reason is that a traditional hierarchy forms a bottleneck: One person has to ask someone else’s permission to do something, and then that person has to ask someone else’s permission, and so on. The whole process is just a waste of time and it prevents people from building things quickly. You can have mentors and collaborators, not commanders. And we all make things here. If you’ve come to climb a ladder, you’re in the wrong place. Those who show up and tell other people what to do don’t last long.</p>
    <h2 id="play-is-important">Play is important</h2>
    <p>When you walk through our doors, you enter an environment where work and play often intertwine. But there’s a difference between being childish and child-like. We are adults. But that doesn’t mean we can’t have fun. There’s no reason to pretend you’re busy. You don’t need to hide the video you’re watching if someone walks by your desk. No one is monitoring the websites you look at. We aren’t going to report you for taking a long lunch. Just do great work.</p>
    <h2 id="we-create-technology-for-people-not-at-them">We create technology for people, not at them</h2>
    <p>We make things for people. Not for consumers. We always ask ourselves (and our clients), “Would I want to use this?”</p>
    <h2 id="show-don-t-tell">Show don’t tell</h2>
    <p>This is something we tell our clients all the time, and it’s important that we live by these words as well. A better way to put it might be: Don’t talk about it, do it.</p>
    <h2 id="take-care-of-your-crew">Take care of your crew</h2>
    <p>Much of the work we do is technical. But there’s another skill we all need to have: the interpersonal kind. It isn’t optional. Some people like to pretend that the technical work is all that matters. They’re wrong. This isn’t Rambo2; there are no teams of one here. We know that sometimes it can be difficult to work with others. Our solution is simple: Get to know everyone. No one is just a developer or a systems engineer. They are people with many dimensions. Understand who they are and it’ll be much easier. You are part of a team, and the health and harmony of your team is part of your job.</p>
    <h2 id="we-are-small-by-design">We are small by design</h2>
    <p>Every decision about how to structure a company has some upsides and some downsides. When you encounter something that’s a little frustrating about how we work, remember that it’s likely the result of something else about this place that you love. We want to keep our company feeling small, which allows us all to sit in the same room and know each other. Sometimes things break or get dirty. We don’t have a maintenance department, so it’s up to you.</p>
    <h2 id="don-t-make-our-company-feel-like-we-are-10-000-people">Don’t make our company feel like we are 10.000 people</h2>
    <p>Try not to over-formalize communication. There’s no need to send an email to the person sitting one row away.</p>
    <h2 id="we-all-talk-to-each-other">We all talk to each other</h2>
    <p>We have an open floor plan and you can access every door. You’re surrounded by smart people from every discipline. Talk to them. Learn from them.</p>
    <h2 id="take-care-of-the-space">Take care of the space</h2>
    <p>We love our space. We’ve got fantastic offices and treat this place like a second home - take care of it accordingly.</p>
    <h2 id="aesthetics-are-important">Aesthetics are important</h2>
    <p>If you make something that doesn’t look good or isn’t usable, you’re going to get called out on it. Don’t worry—this is how we get better. We are strict about this, and soon you will be too. Our code should be clean. Our designs should be amazing. Our presentations should be elegant. Details are everything. Find one and make it awesome.</p>
    <h2 id="all-are-welcome">All are welcome</h2>
    <p>We’ve designed our space for us, not to impress our guests or clients. Anyone is allowed anywhere, anytime. Make yourself at home. If someone drops by, they’re going to see us working. That means it might be a bit messy. But that’s the real us.</p>
    <h2 id="the-kitchen">The kitchen</h2>
    <p>The kitchen is stocked with cutlery, dishes, snacks, drinks, condiments, fruit... Anything not labeled for personal use is fair game. Feel free to use any of the items available, just be respectful of the people and remember to wash dirty dishes and whatever mess you make.</p>
    <p>How to deal with your mess:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Clean your mess until it’s as clean as it was, or even better!</li>
      <li>Use water, dish soap and paper towels where needed.</li>
      <li>...No, wait. That’s it.</li>
      <li>Feel proud of your work.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="we-are-all-learners-we-are-all-teachers">We are all learners; we are all teachers</h2>
    <p>This has nothing to do with seniority. We all snatch the pebble from each other’s hand. The idea of learner becoming teacher and teacher becoming learner is one of the greatest aspects of what we do. We share and learn from each other, daily. And while we don’t expect you to hold anyone’s hand, we encourage you to be a mentor as much as possible. Maybe you’ll learn something too.</p>
    <h2 id="be-respectful-but-don-t-be-delicate">Be respectful, but don’t be delicate</h2>
    <p>We’ve found that the best creative breakthroughs happen when people can have a good, passionate argument about an idea, not when they spend weeks tiptoeing around each other. Don’t be afraid to speak your mind. Just be honest and respectful.</p>
    <h2 id="our-clients-are-part-of-the-team">Our clients are part of the team</h2>
    <p>Just like we pay our dentist, our clients pay us to do the things they can’t do by themselves. Let’s do them well. It won’t always be fun and games when it comes to these relationships, but we should always work with our clients, not for them, and definitely not against them. They need us and we need them. In fact, it’s best to avoid using the word “client” whenever possible. Use their real names. It’ll remind you that we’re all just human beings trying to do good work.</p>
    <h2 id="take-your-client-beyond-their-comfort-zone">Take your client beyond their comfort zone</h2>
    <p>A few things we frequently hear:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“We didn’t expect that at all.”</li>
      <li>“That seems a bit risky.”
        No one gets in trouble for pushing the limit. It’s your job. It’s the reason people look at our work and say, “That’s the kind of work I want to do.”</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="we-are-professionals">We are professionals</h2>
    <p>But we hate professionalism. Professional means handling your business with respect. Professionalism is when you’re so buttoned-up that you stop being yourself. It sands all the edges off your personality.</p>
    <h2 id="avoid-meetings-at-all-cost">Avoid meetings at all cost</h2>
    <p>Meetings are the scourge of the modern workplace. A two-hour meeting with six people doesn’t waste two hours. It wastes twelve hours. If all else fails and you absolutely must have a meeting, clearly state the purpose up front. If you can’t think of one, you probably don’t need to have it. And if you ever—EVER—find yourself in a meeting about a meeting, lace up those sneakers and start running. We get paid to make stuff, not to talk about making stuff.</p>
    <h2 id="write-on-the-walls">Write on the walls</h2>
    <p>Open spaces mean real-time conversations and solutions. That’s why we turned our walls into whiteboards. We sketch out our thoughts as they occur and we share them with the crew. We prefer to work this way: openly and transparently.</p>
    <h2 id="we-are-a-quiet-bunch">We are a quiet bunch</h2>
    <p>Let’s not forget that we’re digital natives here, and many of us are stuck nose-deep in code or are simply quiet folks. Once someone’s settled in and working, they often don’t break their gaze to greet you as you pass by. They’re not being rude, they’re just plugged in. If you need some quiet time, don’t feel guilty about finding a hideout or popping on some headphones. Sometimes, you need quiet not for your own peace of mind, but because we have a guest who doesn’t want to walk into a meeting and have to shout over the sounds of Marco Paulo’s “Taras e Manias”.</p>
    <h2 id="internal-projects">Internal projects</h2>
    <p>Some of our favorite things we make weren’t client work at all. One of us had an idea, and they made it real - Statful. Some companies assign a number for how much time you’re allowed to spend on side projects. We know if it matters to you, you’ll make it happen.</p>
    <h2 id="our-blog">Our blog</h2>
    <p>We have a blog. It will become your new best friend. Write, comment and get involved. Remember we are all learners and teachers.</p>
    <h2 id="wear-a-helmet">Wear a helmet</h2>
    <p>We encourage you to get some fresh air and exercise by biking to work. We have a shower room for convenience.</p>
    <h2 id="weekends">Weekends</h2>
    <p>Our space belongs to all of us. You’re welcome to come by on the weekend. Just be responsible. Lock the doors and windows. Turn off the lights. Take care of the environment, k?</p>
