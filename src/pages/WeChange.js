      <h1>We change</h1>
      <h4>Nothing is sacred. From our habits to our rituals to our environment. Change is a natural part of human life, and we prefer to embrace it.</h4>

    <h2 id="no-cookie-cutters">No cookie cutters</h2>
    <p>Every project we make is 100 percent unique, from the team to the architecture to the solution. We’re not about filling in blanks on templates with “best practices.” It’s like baking bread. You can tell when a loaf of bread was made with love and when it was mass-produced. And it’s not about the skill of the baker. It’s about the attitude.</p>
    <h2 id="get-out-of-your-seat">Get out of your seat</h2>
    <p>It’s unhealthy to stay seated in the same position for eight hours. It’s also terrible for productivity. You aren’t chained to your desk. Move around. Grab some coffee. Play drums or guitar. Meditate. Call your parents. Make a sandwich. Play foosball. Go for a walk. Draw on the walls. Climb a tree. Do yoga. Hit the gym. Get a haircut. Buy some new shoes. Sing a song. Get a snack. Do your laundry. Go birdwatching. Dance. Try Board Games. Write a poem. Learn to juggle. Draw a picture.</p>
    <h2 id="show-tell">Show &amp; tell</h2>
    <p>We encourage you to present or invite interesting people from a variety of backgrounds to share their experience with us. These are extraordinary opportunities.</p>
    <h2 id="clapping">Clapping</h2>
    <p>Sometimes we erupt in spontaneous applause, sometimes we have just delivered something amazing, or for no reason at all. Go ahead, join in.</p>
    <h2 id="tear-down-the-walls">Tear down the walls</h2>
    <p>If you don’t like something, change it. That goes for anything. Seriously. Our office space grows iteratively and it will definitely change over time, so if you want to be a part of that evolution get you voice heard and roll out your sleeves.</p>
    <h2 id="socializing">Socializing</h2>
    <p>We’re friends and coworkers here. We believe that it’s much easier to work with someone once you get to know them on a personal level. We have many social rituals and they top the list of our favorite things about Mindera. Every tradition at Mindera was started by someone like you. Snow trip. Poker tournament. The foosball games. Game night. Show &amp; Tell. Each one exists because someone just decided to do it. Start your own!</p>
    <h2 id="an-ongoing-experiment">An ongoing experiment</h2>
    <p>This place is constantly changing. And change is something we humans resist more than anything else. It’s nobody’s fault; it’s just a biological remnant from our caveman days. Yet as much as we resist change, it’s also how we grow and improve. It’s the sign of a healthy organisation. With new blood comes new thinking – and so we continue the ongoing experiment that is Mindera.</p>
